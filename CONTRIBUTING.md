## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community! If you'd like to contribute to MoodTrackr, follow these steps:

1. Ask code owner to contribute

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Create a new branch for your contributions:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b workitem-{issue-number}
  ```
Replace {issue-number} with the number of the issue you're addressing.

4. Make your changes and commit them:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add your commit message here"
  ```

5. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin workitem-{issue-number}
  ```
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository to the "dev" branch of this repository. Be sure to describe your changes in the PR.

7. The project maintainers will review your PR, and once approved, it will be merged into the dev branch. Periodically, PRs from dev will be merged into the main branch for release.
